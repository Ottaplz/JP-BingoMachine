## JP CLI Bingo Machine

#### How to use?
Build and Run in CLI with .net
1: $ dotnet build
2: $ dotnet run

#### What does it do?
I decided to create this CLI application due to wanting an app to use when playing Japanese Bingo to draw numbers. I figured I may as well create it with C# as that is the language I am comitted to learning at the moment so I thought it would be a neat little project. I am also trying my best to apply clean and scalable code to the best of my ability.

#### Will there be any improvements in the future?
I may make a web app version in the future with some basic animations and the ability for it to be more accessible, but at this stage unless I think of something off the top of my head I really want to add it will stay as is.
